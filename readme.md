### What is nodejs?

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting—running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser.

### Npm packages

Npm is a package manager for the JavaScript programming language. It is the default package manager for the JavaScript runtime environment Node.js. It consists of a command-line client, also called npm, and an online database of public and paid-for private packages, called the npm registry.

### What is express

Express.js, or simply Express, is a back end web application framework for Node.js, released as free and open-source software under the MIT License. It is designed for building web applications and APIs.

### What is middleware

Middleware is a function that has access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next function in the application's request-response cycle. The next function is a function in the Express router that, when invoked, executes the middleware succeeding the current middleware.
